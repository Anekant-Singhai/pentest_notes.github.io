This repo is to guide beginners for learning all the basics required to master the sql-injection

### Setup:
Assumption here made is that your system already has mysql installed and we directly skip to making the databse and inserting the values in the databse so that you can practice your queries

## SQL injection:
SQL injection is a common web application vulnerability where an attacker can manipulate SQL queries executed by the application's database. By injecting malicious SQL statements, attackers can gain unauthorized access to data, modify or delete data, or even execute arbitrary commands on the database server.
These are of 3 types:
### In-band SQL Injection:
In-band SQL Injection refers to an attack where the attacker can retrieve the results of their injected queries directly through the same communication channel used by the application. In-band injections are typically more straightforward to exploit and detect.

Types of In-band SQL Injection:

* Union-Based SQL Injection: The attacker uses the UNION operator to combine query results from multiple tables and extract data.
* Error-Based SQL Injection: Exploits error messages or database errors to extract information from the database.

* Boolean-Based SQL Injection: Exploits conditional statements to infer information by evaluating the truth or falsity of injected queries.

### Blind SQL Injection:
Blind SQL Injection occurs when an attacker injects malicious queries into the application but does not receive the results directly. Instead, the attacker relies on the application's behavior or responses to infer information indirectly. Blind SQL Injection attacks can be more challenging to exploit but can still lead to data leakage or unauthorized access.

Types of Blind SQL Injection:

* Time-Based SQL Injection: Exploits the delay in the application's response to infer information by injecting time-based queries that cause delays.
* Boolean-Based SQL Injection: Exploits conditional statements to infer information by evaluating the application's response.

### Out-of-band SQL Injection:
Out-of-band SQL Injection involves exploiting specific features or functionality of the database management system to establish a separate communication channel for data retrieval. Unlike in-band injections, out-of-band injections rely on alternative channels, such as DNS requests or HTTP requests, to retrieve the results of injected queries.

Types of Out-of-band SQL Injection:

* DNS Exfiltration: Injected queries trigger DNS requests to transmit data to an attacker-controlled server.
* HTTP Exfiltration: Injected queries cause HTTP requests to transfer data to an attacker-controlled server.
